## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chriswritescode-dev/opencode-manager.git
cd opencode-manager
cp .env.example .env
echo "AUTH_SECRET=$(openssl rand -base64 32)" >> .env
docker-compose up -d
```

Open [http://localhost:5003](http://localhost:5003) and create your admin account. That's it!

## What is OpenCode Manager?

OpenCode Manager is a mobile-first web interface for [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai) AI agents. It combines repository management, chat/session control, Git and file tools, schedules, AI configuration, MCP server management, push notifications, and full PWA support into a single responsive application.

- **Repository management** — Clone, discover, and manage multiple Git repos with SSH authentication and worktree support
- **Chat & sessions** — Real-time SSE streaming with slash commands, `@file` mentions, Plan/Build modes, and per-agent model selection
- **Schedules** — Recurring repo jobs with reusable prompts, run history, and linked sessions
- **AI configuration** — Model/provider setup, OAuth for Anthropic/GitHub Copilot, custom agents
- **MCP & Skills** — MCP server management and skill support
- **Audio** — Text-to-speech and speech-to-text (browser + OpenAI-compatible)
- **Mobile & notifications** — Installable PWA with push notifications and mobile-first navigation

## How It Works

OpenCode Manager runs as a pnpm workspace:

- The Bun/Hono backend initializes SQLite, Better Auth, settings, schedules, notifications, and an OpenCode client.
- A supervised OpenCode server handles agent sessions while the backend proxies API calls and streams events over SSE.
- The React/Vite frontend uses React Router and TanStack Query to render repositories, sessions, schedules, settings, and mobile navigation.
- The shared package keeps config, schemas, and TypeScript types aligned between backend and frontend.
